# VariabilityGenetics2019
Analytical code used to determine protein expression variability QTLs. This code is grouped by programming language - where `Rscript/` also contains .Rmd notebooks that are 
designed to be run interactively.

Following is the directory structure for each top-level directory.

Python:
       - LIMIX
       - etc

Rscript:
	- FlowCytometry_Processing
	- Variance_Components_Analysis
	- Post_QTL_Processing
	- Mendelian_Randomisation

Bash:
     - GRM
     - QTL_mapping
     - Post_QTL_Processing
